# TestUserNames
A list of "fake" sound-a-like names that could be used for test environments.  

It is mainly British-English focused, but has a variety of structures including some diacritical marks to verify that your service is compatible with languages outside of the standard 26 characters used in the English Language.

This list is created because of a regular need to generate test accounts and scratching around for unique accounts.
It is also inspired by the "Toby Lerone" feature of the Chris Moyles show on RadioX UK
